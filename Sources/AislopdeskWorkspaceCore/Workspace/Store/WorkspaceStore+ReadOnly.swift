// MARK: - WorkspaceStore × Read-only mode (E17 ES-E17-1 / WI-2)

/// The per-pane READ-ONLY ops, split into their own extension so the (already large) ``WorkspaceStore``
/// body stays under the lint ceiling. They mirror the WB2 active-pane ops
/// (``WorkspaceStore/requestCopyModeInActivePane()``): resolve the active pane's live ``TerminalViewModel``
/// (in whichever live model is active), flip its ``TerminalViewModel/isReadOnly`` input gate, AND record
/// the pane in the observable ``WorkspaceStore/paneReadOnly`` set — the SINGLE source of truth the
/// `🔒 READ ONLY ×` pill, the sidebar lock indicator, and ``isReadOnly(for:)`` all read.
///
/// CONVERGENCE. The model's ``TerminalViewModel/onReadOnlyChanged`` is wired (in
/// ``WorkspaceStore`` `wireMaterializedLeaf`) to update the SAME set, so a flip from ANY entry point — the
/// pill `×` (``setPaneReadOnly(_:_:)`` with `false`), the View-menu item / command-palette term
/// (``toggleReadOnlyInActivePane()``), or a programmatic model toggle — lands on one value. ``setPaneReadOnly``
/// ALSO writes the set DIRECTLY so the convergence holds even for a pane with no live terminal model wired
/// (a non-terminal `.remoteGUI` / `.systemDialog` pane, or a headless / test handle whose
/// `onReadOnlyChanged` the store never installed); the two writes are idempotent (the same value), so they
/// never fight, and the model mutators are guarded idempotent so the one level of re-entrancy through
/// `onReadOnlyChanged` terminates immediately.
