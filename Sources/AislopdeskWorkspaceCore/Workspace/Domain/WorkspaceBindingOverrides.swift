/// extension layers a sparse `bindingID → chord` override map on top.

///   • the registry's framework-neutral ``KeyChord`` (enum `Key` + `Modifiers` OptionSet), the keyboard
///     dispatcher's join key;
///   • W12's serialisable ``KeybindingPreferences/KeyChord`` (a `key: String` + four `Bool` modifier
///     flags), what the Settings UI stores + round-trips.

/// shape so `resolvedChord(for:)` and `resolvedChordTable` honour an override transparently.
