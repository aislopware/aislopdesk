// DispatcherWebChordYieldTests (E18 M2) — the live `WorkspaceKeyDispatcher` YIELDS the otty web-browser
// chords (⌘[ Back / ⌘] Forward / ⌘⇧R hard-Reload / ⌘F Find-in-page) to a FOCUSED `.web` pane instead of
// resolving their global pane-cycle / Toggle-Details / Find bindings. The monitor PREEMPTS the responder
// chain, so without this yield the web pane's focus-scoped `.keyboardShortcut` (WebLeafView) would never see
// these chords — ⌘[ would cycle panes BEHIND the page, ⌘F would open the terminal find bar, etc.
//
// Driven headlessly with synthetic NSEvents (no window-server resource — the hang-safety rule is about
// SCStream/VT/Metal, not NSEvent), asserting the swallow/passthrough contract: with a `.web` leaf active,
// `handle(_:)` returns the event (passthrough), and — the load-bearing control — with a non-web (terminal)
// leaf active the SAME chord is OWNED (swallowed) by the monitor.
//
// FAILS on the pre-fix dispatcher: there was no `activePaneIsWeb` yield, so `handle(⌘[)` returned `nil`
// (swallow) and routed `.cyclePanePrev` even with a web pane focused — the chord never reached the pane.
