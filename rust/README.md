# aislopdesk-core (Rust)

The portable, side-effect-free **core** of Aislopdesk: the wire codecs (terminal
`WireMessage` + the video protocol), FEC + frame reassembly, the realtime controllers
(congestion/ABR, FPS governor, LTR, decode gate/sequencer, jitter-depth pacer,
delay-gradient trendline, recovery admission), coordinate mapping, and the terminal/PTY
protocol incl. the SSH-style channel mux + per-channel flow control. Safe Rust, zero
runtime dependencies.

The Swift/SwiftUI apps are the platform shell (ScreenCaptureKit capture, VideoToolbox
codec, Metal, input injection, PTY spawn, UI). They call this core over a C-ABI boundary:
`aislopdesk-ffi` → the `CAislopdeskFFI` SwiftPM target → `libaislopdesk_ffi.a` (built by
`rust/build-apple.sh`, macOS arm64 slice; iOS slices are a follow-up). The same core is
the basis for an **Android client** over C-ABI / JNI — the ALVR split: Rust owns
reassembly/FEC/jitter/ABR/recovery; the platform shell owns capture, the socket, and the
hardware codec.

## Why a C-ABI boundary

The boundary is a **hand-written, zero-dependency C header** (`aislopdesk_ffi.h`),
mirroring the `#[repr(C)]` surface by hand. cbindgen was considered but the header is
hand-maintained to keep the crate dependency-free. C ABI over uniffi (its callback
interfaces are soft-deprecated and its serialization is unfit for 60 fps); libsignal and
ALVR use the same C-ABI boundary.

## Invariants

- **No `unsafe`** in the core — enforced crate-wide by `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The only
  crate permitted `unsafe` is the `aislopdesk-ffi` boundary.
- **No dependencies** in the shipped library (dev-only `serde_json` for the parity test).
- **Never panics on untrusted input** — every decoder of network bytes returns `Result`; a
  corrupt datagram is dropped, never a crash. (The one documented panic is host-side
  `packetize` on a >77 MB frame — unreachable from the wire.)

## Verification

`aislopdesk-corevectors` (a Swift executable) emits a deterministic JSON corpus exercising
every codec/decision family through its public API. The Rust `golden_parity` integration
test replays it and asserts **byte-identical** encoder output and **bit-identical** numeric
output (coordinate math, YCbCr coefficients, and the controllers' EWMA / OLS-regression /
median / threshold float state, all via IEEE bit patterns). Regenerate after any
wire/controller change:

```sh
swift run aislopdesk-corevectors > rust/aislopdesk-core/tests/vectors/golden_vectors.json
```

On top of the golden corpus:

- **Per-subsystem differential + fuzz tests** across the codec and controller families
  (round-trips, edge cases, FEC recovery, reassembly scenarios, ABR/FEC decision tables,
  hostile-input drops).
- **`aislopdesk-ffi`**: 27 tests, `clippy --all-targets` clean, `fmt` clean, and a real C
  smoke test (`-Werror` against the `.a`) proving ABI agreement.
- **Full app suite** green (~2188 tests, 0 failures).
- **HW loopback E2E** (`aislopdesk-loopback-validate --smoke`, unsandboxed): real HEVC
  encode → packetize → reassemble → decode (10/10) plus the controller drive, 0 failures.

## Develop

```sh
cd rust
cargo test                  # unit + golden-parity
cargo clippy --all-targets  # pedantic, zero warnings expected
cargo fmt --check
./build-apple.sh            # libaislopdesk_ffi.a (macOS arm64) for CAislopdeskFFI
```

## Roadmap

Implemented:

- the complete video-protocol wire surface (the ALVR boundary spine);
- all 14 pure realtime controllers (ABR/congestion, fps governor, LTR, decode
  gate/sequencer, jitter-depth pacer policy, delay-gradient trendline, recovery admission);
- the complete terminal/PTY path (PATH 1): the `WireMessage` framing, the SSH-style channel
  mux (`MuxEnvelope`/`MuxFrameDecoder`/`ChannelTable`), and the per-channel credit flow
  control (`FlowCreditPolicy`/`ReceiveWindowAccountant`/`BoundedQueuePolicy`) — see
  [`terminal`](aislopdesk-core/src/terminal). Kept in its own namespace (own error type +
  big-endian reader) to mirror the module boundary;
- the **C-ABI boundary** (`aislopdesk-ffi`): the `extern "C"` surface — `staticlib` for
  Apple, `cdylib` for a dynamic/Android consumer — with a hand-maintained C header and a
  real C smoke test. It covers the terminal path's streaming `FrameDecoder` (opaque
  handle), the `WireMessage` codec (a flat `#[repr(C)]` struct + `encode`), and wrap-aware
  `seq` arithmetic — enough to exercise every hard boundary pattern (opaque handles,
  Rust-owned buffers, status codes, null-safety).

Next:

1. **Widen the FFI surface**: extend the boundary over the video pipeline — `Reassembler` /
   FEC and the realtime controllers — as a coarse "Rust owns the pipeline" seam (the shell
   pumps datagrams in and gets assembled NAL units + encoder decisions out via a zero-copy
   callback), then the remaining terminal mux/flow-control. The header can move to `cbindgen`
   generation (with a CI check that it matches the curated header) once the surface is large
   enough to warrant it.
2. **Android build**: `cargo-ndk` producing `.so`s for `aarch64/armv7/x86_64-linux-android`
   plus a JNI shim, behind a foreground service for Doze.

Each tranche keeps the same discipline: golden + differential tests, no shipped
dependencies, no `unsafe` in the core (only in `aislopdesk-ffi`).
